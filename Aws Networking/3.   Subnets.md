# 3. Aws Subnets:

## 3.1. Vpc Subnets Ipv4 :

+ AWS reserves 5 ip addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet.
+ These 5 ip addresses are not available for use and cant be assighned to an EC2 Instance.

### Example:

+ Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:

  '''
     10.0.0.0 - Network Addresses
	 10.0.0.1 - Reserved by Aws for vpc router.
	 10.0.0.2 - Reserved by Aws for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS.
	 10.0.0.3 - reserved by Aws for future use.
	 10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. Aws does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore the address is reserved.
	 
  '''

## 3.2. Create Subnet:

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Subnets.
3. Choose Create subnet.
4. For VPC ID: Choose the VPC for the subnet.
5. For Availability Zone, you can choose a Zone for your subnet, or leave the default No Preference to let AWS choose one for you.
6. For IPv4 CIDR block, enter an IPv4 CIDR block for your subnet. For example, 10.0.1.0/24. If you chose IPv6-only, this option is unavailable.
7. Choose Create subnet.
