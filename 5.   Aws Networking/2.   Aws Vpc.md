## 2.1. Default VPC:

+ All new AWS Accounts have a default VPC.
+ New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified.
+ Default VPC has internet connectivity and all EC2 intances inside it have public ipv4 addresses.
+ We also get a public and private ipv4 DNS Names.

### Example:

## 2.2. VPC :

+ VPC = Virtual Private Cloud.
+ You can have multiple VPC's in an AWS region ( max.5 per region - soft linit ).
+ Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR.
  Min size is /28 (16 Ip addresses)
  Max  size is /16 (65536 Ip addresses)
+ Because VPC is private only the private IPV4 ranges are allowed.

1. 10.0.0.0    to  10.255.255.255.255
2. 172.16.0.0  to  172.31.255.255  
3. 192.168.0.0 to  192.168.255.255

+ Your VPC CIDR should NOT Overlap with your other networks.
