# 1. EC2 Instance Basics:


## 1.1. What is an EC2 Instance.

+ EC2 = ECC = Elastic Cloud Compute.
+ Amazon EC2 provides Virtual Instances in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.
+ Virtual Machines in Virtual Infra known as instances in Cloud Computing.
+ Aws users can create and access instances from any where using internet.

## 1.2. What are the Types of Ec2 Instances.

+ There are diff types of Ec2 Instance types:


### 1. General Purpose Instance:

+ The General Purpose Instance balances computing, memory, and networking resources.

#### Examples:

1. Application servers
2. Gaming servers
3. Backend servers for companies
4. Small and medium databases



### 2. Compute Optimized Instances:

+ The Compute Optimized Instances are best there is a need for high compute.
+ This type is also good for application servers, gaming servers, and web applications.
+ The main difference is that this type is ideal for high-performance and compute-intensive needs.



### 3. Memory Optimized Instances:

+ This type can deliver large dataset workloads fast.
+ Memory is a temporary storage area.
+ It loads from storage, holds the data, and processes it before the computer can run it.
+ The processing allows for a preloading process and gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.
+ The Memory Optimized Instances are best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.


### 4. Accelerated Computing Instances:

+ This type use hardware accelerators.
+ The accelerators boost the data processing.
+ The Accelerated Computing Instances are best for graphics applications and streaming.


### 5. Storage Optimized Instances:

+ This type is best when you have large datasets on local storage.

#### Some examples:

1. Large file systems
2. Data warehouses
3. Online transaction systems.

## 1.3. EC2 Pricing Models:

### 1. On Demand Instances:

+ On Demand Instances are best used for short-term workloads.
+ It requires no upfront costs or minimum amount on the purchase.
+ The instances run until you stop them.
+ You pay for what you use.



### 2. AWS EC2 Savings Plan:

+ The savings plan is a commitment for usage over a 1-year or 3-year term.
+ Committing to a period gives a discounted price.
+ If you surpass the budget, the cost goes to normal (on-demand) prices.



### 3. Reserved Instances:

+ The Reserved Instances are used to reserve instances for an agreed period.
+ The options are for 1-year or 3-years. The latter one gives the highest discount.




### 4. Spot Instances:

+ This pricing model is best for workloads with flexible start and end times, which can take interruptions.
+ Spot instances can give up to a 90% cost savings.
+ The reason behind the discount is that AWS can optimize its capacity, giving you better prices.


### 5. Dedicated Hosts:

+ Dedicated hosts are physical servers fully dedicated to you.
+ You can use your existing VM software licenses.
+ The Dedicated Host is the most expensive model.
