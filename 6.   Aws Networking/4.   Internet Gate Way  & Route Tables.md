# 4. Internet Gateway & Route Tables:

## 4.1. Internet Gateway (IGW):

+ Allows resources (eg.EC2 Instances) in a VPC Connect to the internet.
+ it scales horizontally and its highly available and redundant.
+ Must be created seperately from a VPC.
+ One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa.
+ Internet Gateways on their own do not allow internet accesses.
+ Route Tables must also be edited.

 
## 4.2. Create Internet Gateway:

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Internet gateways, and then choose Create internet gateway.
3. Optionally name your internet gateway.
4. Optionally add or remove a tag
5. Choose Create internet gateway.
6. Select the internet gateway that you just created, and then choose Actions, Attach to VPC.
7. Select your VPC from the list, and then choose Attach internet gateway.


## 4.3. Route Tables:

+ Amazon defines A route table containing a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
+ When a network packet arrives at a Router, it determines the destination IP address of a received packet and makes the routing decisions to send a packet to its     destination.

### Main Route Table:
+ When you create a VPC, automatically a default route table is associated with your VPC, known as the Main Route Table. 
+ It controls the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table.

### Custom Route Table:

+ You can create a custom route table for your VPC and you can add, remove, and modify the routes. 
+ One way to protect your VPC is to leave the main route table without any modification and then explicitly associate the subnet with a custom route table as per       your requirement. 
+ Custom route table helps to control how each subnet routes traffic.

## 4.4. Create & Edit  Route Tables:
+ you can create dedicated route tables for private and public subnets or diff subnets.
+ Create Route Tables.
+ Edit Routetable for Subnet Associations.
+ Add Subnets to RouteTables.


## 4.4. Edit Route for Above Created Route Tables:

+ Create one rule for 0.0.0.0/0  to IGW for Public Subnets to get internet to resources.
+ Add custom rules as per your requirement.
